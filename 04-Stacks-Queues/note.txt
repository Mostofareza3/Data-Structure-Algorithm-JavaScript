1. What is a Stack?
ans:
    Stack is a LIFO data structure.
    The last element added to the Stack will be the first element removed from the stack.
    Just Like a Book Shelf. or you can think about a stack of plates. As you pile it up the last things gets removed fist.

2. Where Stacks are used?
    ans: 
        * Managing function invocation.
        * Undo / Redo.
        * Routing (the history object) is treated like stack.

3. How many ways you can implement a Stack?
    ans:
        There is more than one way of implementing a Stack.
        - Array Implementation.
        - Linked List Implementation

4. Explain Stack implementation using Array.
    ans:
        Here are two major implementation of Stack using the Array.
        * we can use unshift() and shift() built in method.
        * or we can use push() and pop() built in method.
        but we know that shift(), unshift() time complexity is O(n). On the other hand push(),pop() time complexity is O(1). 

        so we should always use push & pop methods.


5. Big O of Stack.
    insertion -> 0(1)
    removal -> 0(1)
    searching -> 0(n)
    access -> 0(n)


6. What is a Queue?
    ans:
        A FIFO (Fist In Fist Out) data structure. Queues exist everywhere! Think about the last time you waited in line for a bus Ticket.

7. How Do we use Queues in programming?
    ans:
        - Background Tasks.
        - Uploading resources.
        - Printing / Task processing.

8. How we implement Queue using Array?
ans:
    1. Array.push() and Array.shift() combination.
    2. Array.unshift() and Array.pop() combination.
